# Mars Web Scraping and Data Analysis Project

In this assignment, I tackled two major tasks that involved web scraping and data analysis centered around Mars:

## Part 1: Scraping Mars News
In this part, I automated web browsing to collect titles and preview text from the Mars News website. Utilizing Beautiful Soup, I parsed the HTML to extract the desired data, storing it efficiently in Python dictionaries. Each dictionary included 'title' and 'preview' keys, and I organized all the dictionaries within a Python list. This meticulous data collection process allowed me to compile the latest news on Mars in a structured format.

## Part 2: Scraping and Analyzing Mars Weather Data
Moving on to the second part, I continued my web scraping journey by accessing Mars temperature data from a specific URL. Using Beautiful Soup once again, I extracted the data from an HTML table and transformed it into a well-structured Pandas DataFrame. I conducted a comprehensive analysis, which included determining the number of months on Mars, calculating Martian days worth of data, identifying the coldest and warmest months, finding the months with the lowest and highest atmospheric pressure, and estimating terrestrial days in a Martian year. Visualizations were also generated to provide clear insights into the data.

Throughout this assignment, I honed my web scraping skills, gained proficiency in data manipulation, analysis, and visualization, and concluded by exporting the valuable data I had processed to a CSV file for future reference and sharing.

These tasks collectively showcased my capability to proficiently gather and process data from web sources, leading to meaningful insights.
